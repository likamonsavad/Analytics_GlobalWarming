# Reconstruct the NOAA simple Visualization of Global Surface Temperature 
As of now, NOAA have been represented simple visualization of global surface temperature for the researcher without analyzation of factors involved in changes of temperture. 
I digged deep into the data of the greenhouse gases lavel such as carbon dioxide and Methaneand discovered the significant correlation between a rise in global temperature and the greenhouses gases.

**The process in this analysis:**
1. Descriptive:
2. Diagnostic:
3. Predictive:
4. Prescriptive:
