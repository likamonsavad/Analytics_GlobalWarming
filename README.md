# Reconstruct the NOAA simple Visualization of Global Surface Temperature 
  As of now, NOAA have been represented simple visualization of global surface temperature for the researcher without analyzation of any factor involved in changes of temperture. I digged deep into the greenhouse gases lavel dataset such as carbon dioxide and Methaneand, and discovered the significant correlation between a rise in global temperature and the greenhouses gases. 
  **Then, I decided to reconstruct the NOAA visualization and rearranged data being ready for global warming analyzation and  feed the cleaned data into Power BI**
