# Reconstruct the NOAA simple Visualization of Global Surface Temperature 
  As of now, NOAA has been represented simple visualization of global surface temperature for the researcher without analyzation of any factor involved in changes of temperture. I digged deep into the greenhouse gases lavel dataset such as carbon dioxide and Methaneand, and discovered the significant correlation between a rise in global temperature and the greenhouses gases. 
  **Then, I decided to reconstruct the NOAA visualization and rearranged data for global warming analysis and feed the data into Power BI**
